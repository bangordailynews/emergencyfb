## EmergencyFB

This is the start of a project to scrape all of Maine's police and fire Facebook pages into one feed. I started this project sometime in 2015 and I'm sure it never worked and make no guarantees about where this project is at (as of March 2016).

You can see the list of Facebook accounts at [data.txt](data.txt).

You can see just a JSON list of the Facebook IDs at [app/facebookIDs.json](app/facebookIDs.json).

I started to write importer.php to scrape them but I have no idea how far I got. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
